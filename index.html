        <h2>Crocs first appeared on the shoe scene in 2002</h2>
        <p>
          Three friends, Scott Seamans, Lyndon Hanson, and George Boeddecker
          Jr., united over their love for the water and an innovative shoe idea.
          While sailing in the Caribbean, they stumbled upon a distinctive kind
          of boat shoe created by Foam Creations, a Canadian company. These
          shoes were made from a material called Croslite, which was
          lightweight, comfortable, and perfect for boating. Intrigued and
          inspired, the trio decided to acquire the rights to manufacture shoes
          using this Croslite material. That decision marked the birth of Crocs
          shoes.
          <br />
          Colorado natives Scott Seamans, Lyndon ‚ÄúDuke‚Äù Hanson, and George
          Boedecker, Jr. founded Crocs in 2001 after innovating on a foam clog
          by Canadian brand Foam Creations, which Crocs later acquired. The
          first model produced by Crocs, the Beach, was introduced at the 2002
          Fort Lauderdale Boat Show in Florida.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Inspired by the Dutch clog, Crocs were originally designed to be
          boating shoes.
        </h2>
        <p>
          This simple fact may provide some clarity to the polarizing Crocs'
          design and material makeup. The shoes were originally created for
          boaters, prioritizing grip-focused soles, waterproof materials, and
          foot protection. Pulling from the design of clogs, Crocs were also
          designed to be easy to take on and off, which is great for the high
          seas‚Äîor just running errands.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>That proprietary Crocs foam is a thing of legends.</h2>
        <p>
          Designed to perform on both land and sea, Crocs are made of a patented
          foam called Croslite. The foam, which is exclusive to Crocs, is
          actually closed-cell resin, not plastic or rubber as one might assume.
          The brand further innovated on Croslite in 2018, creating LiteRide, a
          material that is ‚Äú25% lighter and 40% softer than Croslite, while
          still providing shock absorption and support,‚Äù according to Fast
          Company.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why are Crocs called Crocs? Yes, crocodiles.</h2>
        <p>
          Now that you know all about the foam, the name ‚ÄúCrocs‚Äù will likely
          make more sense. Since the shoes were designed to perform on both land
          and sea, the brand pulled its name from the multi-environment,
          amphibious crocodile.
        </p>

        <h2>There are exactly 13 holes on each pair of Crocs.</h2>
        <p>
          Whether you're looking at a pair of kids' Crocs or men's size 15
          Crocs, each pair has 13 holes on the top of the shoe. But they aren't
          just there for aesthetics. The holes serve as ventilation and let out
          excess moisture to keep the shoes fresh.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>
          Crocs acquired family-owned company Jibbitz to turn those holes into
          profitable charm holders.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Sheri Schmelzer and her husband Rich started Jibbitz in 2005 after
          Sheri became inspired to decorate her kids' Crocs with faux flowers
          and charms. The business soon took off as a way to personalize the
          popular comfort-first shoes. Crocs took notice and acquired the
          company in 2006 for $10 million, with another $10 million promised if
          the sister company met earning goals. Now some 15 years later, Jibbitz
          charms are still a major part of the Crocs empire.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Crocs has sold more than 720 million pairs of shoes since its
          inception.
        </h2>
        <p>
          That's a whole lot of foam shoes. Crocs are sold in more than 90
          countries worldwide, making those big numbers possible.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Crocs donates millions of shoes.</h2>
        <p>
          The brand regularly donates shoes to those in need through their Crocs
          Cares program. Since March 2020, Crocs has donated more than 1 million
          pairs of shoes to healthcare workers globally.
